# Discrete Text Sequence

Instead of character-by-character typewriter, replace entire string states at time thresholds — enabling non-linear effects (typos, backspaces, bulk paste, "thinking" gaps) that smooth per-char typing can't achieve. If your effect is "type each character, no edits", this rule is overkill — use the smooth-slice variation below.

## How It Works

The typing is authored as a sparse array of `{ t, text }` states; on every `onUpdate` a **reverse search** finds the latest entry whose `t` has passed and renders its text. Display jumps between states with no animation between them — the realism comes from the schedule shape: fast keystroke clusters (0.06–0.20s apart), pauses at word breaks (0.3–0.6s), a typo, backspaces peeling back to the fork, then a bulk paste replacing many chars in one entry. A block cursor blinks via a deterministic sin square wave on the same timeline.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="terminal">
  <div class="prompt">$</div>
  <div class="text-wrap">
    <span class="text" id="text"></span><span class="cursor" id="cursor">_</span>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.terminal {
  font-family: {monoFont}; /* monospace required — proportional jitters even in a fixed box */
  display: flex;
  align-items: baseline;
  font-size: TERMINAL_FONT_SIZE;
}
.text-wrap {
  display: inline-flex;
  align-items: baseline;
  min-width: TEXT_WRAP_MIN_WIDTH; /* ≥ widest state — stops right-edge jitter */
  white-space: nowrap;
}
.cursor {
  display: inline-block; /* inline ignores width */
  width: CURSOR_WIDTH;
}
```

```js
// Each entry shows from its t until the NEXT entry's t.
// Shape: keystrokes → typo → backspace to the fork → bulk paste → completion mark.
const SEQUENCE = [
  { t: 0.0, text: "" },
  { t: T_K1, text: "{p1}" }, // first keystrokes (~3-5 chars, 0.1-0.2s apart)
  { t: T_K2, text: "{p1 + ' ' + p2_typo}" }, // continuation containing a typo
  { t: T_BS, text: "{p1 + ' ' + p2_partial}" }, // backspace(s) — peel back to the fork
  { t: T_BULK, text: "{fullCorrectedText}" }, // bulk paste — many chars in one jump
  { t: T_DONE, text: "{fullCorrectedText + ' ✓'}" }, // completion marker
];

// Reverse-search for the latest entry whose t has passed
function textAt(time) {
  for (let i = SEQUENCE.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (time >= SEQUENCE[i].t) return SEQUENCE[i].text;
  }
  return "";
}

const textEl = document.getElementById("text");
const cursorEl = document.getElementById("cursor");

const driver = { t: 0 };
tl.to(
  driver,
  {
    t: TOTAL_DURATION,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      textEl.textContent = textAt(driver.t);
    },
  },
  0,
);

// Cursor blink — deterministic sin square wave, never a CSS animation
const blink = { p: 0 };
tl.to(
  blink,
  {
    p: Math.PI * 2 * BLINK_CYCLES,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      cursorEl.style.opacity = Math.sin(blink.p) > 0 ? "1" : "0";
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

## Variations

- **Smooth character slice** (continuous typewriter — no pauses, no edits): faster to author but uniformly "machine-typed", missing the human realism:

```js
const fullText = "{fullPhrase}";
const len = { v: 0 };
tl.to(
  len,
  {
    v: fullText.length,
    duration: TYPE_DUR,
    ease: "power1.inOut",
    onUpdate: () => {
      textEl.textContent = fullText.substring(0, Math.floor(len.v));
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

- **Thinking pause** — hold one state for `THINK_HOLD_DUR` (0.8–2.0s; under 0.5s reads as a stutter, not thought) simply by leaving a gap before the next entry's `t`.
- **State pulse on completion** — when the final state lands, `tl.to(".text", { scale: 1.03–1.08, duration: 0.15–0.3, yoyo: true, repeat: 1 }, T_DONE)`.
- **Per-state color shift** — in `onUpdate`, branch on `driver.t` vs the milestones: success color after `T_DONE`, dim mid-edit, normal while typing.

| TEXT_WRAP_MIN_WIDTH | ≥ widest state                               | measure with a hidden probe after `document.fonts.ready` if unsure     |
| milestone `t`s      | keystrokes 0.06–0.20s apart; pauses 0.3–0.6s | monotonically increasing; `T_DONE ≤ TOTAL_DURATION − ~1s` climax dwell |
| TYPE_DUR (smooth)   | `chars × 0.06–0.12s`                         | fast → relaxed                                                         |
| BLINK_CYCLES        | one cycle per 0.5–0.8s                       | `TOTAL_DURATION / 0.8 ≤ BLINK_CYCLES ≤ TOTAL_DURATION / 0.5`           |

## Critical Constraints

- **Reverse-search the array each frame** — O(n) with small n (≤30 typical); don't index by frame, the sequence is sparse.
- **`min-width` on the text wrap is mandatory** — without it the right edge jitters as state length changes.
- **Discrete jumps must be INSTANT** — any transition on the text turns the jump into a smear and kills the "typing" feel.
- **Cursor blink is sin/sequence-driven on the timeline**, `display: inline-block`, monospace font, `white-space: nowrap` (wrapping mid-state breaks the illusion; trailing spaces must survive).
- **Discrete vs smooth** — use discrete only for non-linear states (typos, pauses, bulk paste); plain typing takes the smooth-slice variation.

## Selected motion rule: scale-swap-transition

name: scale-swap-transition
description: Coordinated shrink-out + spring pop-in morph-like transition between two elements — no SVG path interpolation needed.
metadata:
  tags: transition, morph, scale, swap, spring, pop

# Scale-Swap Transition

Simulates a "morph" between two DOM elements by overlapping exit and entrance scale animations. Lighter weight than [card-morph-anchor.md](card-morph-anchor.md) (which morphs container dimensions — use that for SHAPE changes; this rule is for SAME-shape state swaps) and easier than SVG path interpolation.

At a single trigger, two coordinated tweens fire:

1. **Outgoing**: scale `1.0 → EXIT_SCALE` + opacity `1 → 0`, fast `power2.in` (rushing away).
2. **Incoming**: scale `EXIT_SCALE → 1.0` + opacity `0 → 1`, `back.out(BOUNCE_FACTOR)` (arriving with weight).

A small `OVERLAP` window during which both are mid-tween creates the morph illusion; the incoming sits on top via z-index so the outgoing's fade-tail doesn't bleed through.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- Both cards position: absolute; inset: 0 in one fixed-size wrapper — same
     footprint, same transform-origin: 50% 50%. Incoming starts opacity: 0,
     transform: scale(EXIT_SCALE), z-index above the outgoing. -->
<div class="swap-wrap">
  <div class="card outgoing" id="outgoing">{outgoingIcon} {outgoingLabel}</div>
  <div class="card incoming" id="incoming">
    {incomingIcon} {incomingLabel}
    <div class="sub" id="sub">{incomingSubline}</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

```js
// Outgoing: shrink + fade fast
tl.to(
  "#outgoing",
  { scale: EXIT_SCALE, opacity: 0, duration: EXIT_DUR, ease: "power2.in" },
  TRIGGER,
);

// Incoming: pops in with overshoot, starting OVERLAP before the exit finishes
tl.to(
  "#incoming",
  { scale: 1.0, opacity: 1, duration: ENTER_DUR, ease: `back.out(${BOUNCE_FACTOR})` },
  TRIGGER + EXIT_DUR - OVERLAP,
);

// Inner content reveals AFTER the incoming settles
tl.fromTo(
  "#sub",
  { opacity: 0, y: SUB_REVEAL_Y_PX },
  { opacity: 1, y: 0, duration: SUB_REVEAL_DUR, ease: "power3.out" },
  TRIGGER + EXIT_DUR + SUB_REVEAL_DELAY,
);
```

## Variations

- **Delayed inner content reveal** — the classic pattern above: morph the container, then reveal inner text once it settles; the 0.2–0.4 s gap lets the eye land on the new shape before reading.
- **Triple swap (3-state cycle)** — chain A→B→C with triggers `TRIGGER_AB` / `TRIGGER_BC`; each transition is its own tween pair, the previous incoming becoming the next outgoing. State-evolution narratives (early → mid → final labels).
- **Color-shift transition (no scale)** — for a flat morph between same-shape states, drop the scale and keep opacity + a brief background hue tween; less dramatic, more product-UI tone.

| SUB_REVEAL_DELAY | 0.2–0.4 s                             | reveals during the morph compete with the swap for attention                                           |
| BRAND_REVEAL_AT  | < TRIGGER                             | context (brand, eyebrow) sets the stage early; revealed AT the swap it competes with the headline beat |

## Critical Constraints

- **Incoming z-index ABOVE outgoing** — otherwise the outgoing's fade-tail (opacity 0.3–0.5) bleeds through and double-exposes the frame.
- **Both elements share `transform-origin: 50% 50%`** — different origins make the morph read as one thing teleporting elsewhere.
- **Bouncy ease ONLY on the incoming** — outgoing `power2.in`, incoming `back.out`; reversed, the swap feels mechanical.
- **Both cards `position: absolute; inset: 0`** in the same fixed-size wrapper (sized to fit both states; the wrap never resizes).
- **Don't `display: none` the outgoing** after the fade — leave it at `opacity: 0` so layout doesn't reflow.
- **Inner content reveals after the container settles**; **climax dwell ≥ 1 s** after the final state + subline land.

# Sine Wave Loop (subtle jitter / bounded ambient)

> **Reach for this last.** Per the motion doctrine (`references/motion-language.md`): circular breathing — scaling text/cards up and down to look "alive" — is cheap, the agent's reflexive cheat, and reads weak. "I'd rather have NO motion than BAD motion." First fill the back of a shot with **sequential reveal timed to the VO**; if a frame has genuinely settled and still needs life, the **sanctioned move is subtle jitter** — this rule at the LOW end of its amplitude range. A full breathing loop is the rare last resort on a single held hero, never stamped on every element.

Keeps a settled element from feeling dead using `Math.sin` on the timeline clock. Two forms:

- **Yoyo form** — one `sine.inOut` tween with `yoyo: true` and a **finite** `repeat` count. Preferred when the idle stands alone on a property nothing else touches.
- **onUpdate form** — one long `ease: "none"` tween drives a `phase` proxy `0 → 2π·CYCLES`; `onUpdate` maps `Math.sin(phase)` into the transform. Required when the offset multiplies/adds onto another live value (compound transforms, amplitude envelopes, multi-octave).

Either way, idle begins where the entry settled: at `phase = 0`, `sin(0) = 0` — the offset is zero, so there is no jump from the entry's resting state.

## Recipe

```js
// onUpdate form — phase-driven, composable.
const phase = { p: 0 };
tl.to(
  phase,
  {
    p: Math.PI * 2 * CYCLES,
    duration: IDLE_DUR,
    ease: "none", // sine provides the easing; a non-linear phase tween distorts the wave
    onUpdate: () => {
      const s = Math.sin(phase.p);
      hero.style.transform = `translateY(${s * Y_AMP_PX}px) scale(${1 + s * SCALE_AMP})`;
      // secondary elements: offset by Math.PI / 2 — synced motion looks mechanical
      dot.style.transform = `scale(${1 + Math.sin(phase.p + Math.PI / 2) * DOT_SCALE_AMP})`;
    },
  },
  IDLE_START_TIME,
);

// Yoyo form — standalone property, finite repeats.
tl.to(
  "#badge",
  { y: -Y_AMP_PX, duration: PERIOD / 2, ease: "sine.inOut", yoyo: true, repeat: REPEATS },
  IDLE_START_TIME,
);
```

## Variations

- **Multi-octave** (organic): stack a higher-frequency overlay — `1 + Math.sin(p) * AMP_PRIMARY + Math.sin(p * OCTAVE_RATIO) * AMP_SECONDARY`, with `AMP_SECONDARY < AMP_PRIMARY` and the combined max inside the normal SCALE_AMP range.
- **Settle and fade** (strongly recommended when `IDLE_DUR > 6s`): ramp amplitude to zero over the last ~20% of idle so the scene visibly settles before the inter-scene transition, instead of handing off mid-drift:

```js
const t = phase.p / (Math.PI * 2 * CYCLES); // 0 → 1 across idle
const env = t < 1 - FADE_FRAC ? 1 : (1 - t) / FADE_FRAC; // FADE_FRAC ≈ 0.2
const scale = 1 + Math.sin(phase.p) * SCALE_AMP * env;
```

This is the single biggest fix when finalize snapshots show "everything's still moving at the end"; it pairs naturally with break-boundary transitions (the outgoing visual is static when the crossfade/push begins).

## Critical Constraints

- **Prefer reveal, then jitter, then breath** — the doctrine order above; default to the LOW end of every amplitude range. At the upper end across 5+ consecutive scenes the whole film reads as "shimmering".
- **Long idle window** (`IDLE_DUR > 6s` OR idle > 30% of composition): halve `SCALE_AMP` / `Y_AMP_PX`, slow the period to 3–4s, and add the settle-and-fade tail.
- **Concurrent idle on N elements** (columns, card grid, stat row): per-element amplitude ≤ default `/ √N`, AND stagger the periods (2.1s / 1.9s / 2.4s). Three columns at ±6px compound to ±18px of competing motion; three at ±2–3px read as one collective breath.
- **Compose, don't replace** — idle ADDS to the element's resting transform; never overwrite the entry's final translation.
- **Phase tween `ease: "none"`** — sine itself is the curve.
- **No CSS `@keyframes` for idle** — CSS animation runs on the browser's render clock, independent of the HF seek clock; a CSS-driven idle flickers/desyncs. Drive idle inside the timeline.
